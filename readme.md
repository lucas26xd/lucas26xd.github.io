# Overview
The code runs entirely in the client browser (frontend), uses only HTML, CSS and JS.

> There is only one file ([index.html](https://github.com/lucas26xd/lucas26xd.github.io/blob/master/index.html)) where all the code is found, I tried to indent and comment whenever possible, and all images on the site are taken by URL.

# Thanks
* I use Material Icons for contact icons at the bottom of the page.

* I use Bootstrap for an improved and responsive look and its ease of use.

* I used the Formspree email server for its ease of use and fast email delivery.

* I use the Github API to search my repositories and list them on the page, this process is fully automatic via JS.

* I used the JSON found [here](https://github.com/ozh/github-colors) to get the default language colors from github, thanks a lot man (https://github.com/ozh)!
